# Starter Project

Welcome to the Dash Starter Project!

From the project directory, run
* `npm install` (you only need to do this if you are running it for the first time!)
* `npm start`
* `go to http://localhost:3000` in Chrome or Firefox

If you have issues (or if you're running it for the first time), run `npm install` in the project directory and repeat the above steps.
